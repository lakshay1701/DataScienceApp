    <string name="slider_screen_1">Hello there! Let\'s begin with a story</string>
    <string name="slider_screen2">In the year 1854,London,the capital city of the England, experienced an outbreak of Cholera.</string>
    <string name="slider_screen_3">The sad thing was, no one really knew what Cholrea was or how to go about treating it.</string>
    <string name="slider_screen_4">It was considered that such diseases spread through the air while it really was a water-borne disease.</string>
    <string name="slider_screen_5">At that time, John Snow, a young British doctor did not really buy the idea of Cholera spreading through the air. He started looking around.</string>
    <string name="slider_screen_6">He tracked down information from hospital and public records on when the outbreak began and tried to see what was common to the victims.</string>
    <string name="slider_screen_7">He put out all collected information onto a map of London.</string>
    <string name="slider_screen_9">Several interesting facts came to light by looking at this colored map-  Blocks near Broad street seemed to be heavily affected while neighboring blocks, just a mile or so away, seemed to be totally unaffected.</string>
    <string name="slider_screen_11">What was going on?</string>
    <string name="slider_screen_12">John discovered that people in the nearby unaffected blocks used a different hand pump to fetch water than those living near Broad street.</string>
    <string name="slider_screen_13">This helped Snow rule out other possible sources of the epidemic besides pump water.</string>
    <string name="slider_screen_14">On 7 September 1854, Snow took his research to the town officials and convinced them to take the handle off the pump, making it impossible to draw water.</string>
    <string name="slider_screen_15">The officials were reluctant to believe him, but took the handle off as a trial only to find the outbreak of cholera which almost immediately trickled to a stop.</string>
    <string name="slider_screen_16">Little by little, people who had left their homes and businesses in the Broad Street area out of fear of getting Cholera began to return.</string>
    <string name="slider_screen_17">What John Snow did in this example is what data science actually is!</string>
    <string name="slider_screen_18">Data Science is  learning new things about our world by collecting and analyzing information of events that have taken place.</string>
    <string name="slider_screen_19">In this example, John Snow showed how relating data on peopleâ€™s source of water to the places they lives was able to show possibly infected hand pumps.</string>
